# Visualizing Nginx Access Logs using Grafana and Metabase
In my last [blog post](https://www.timeplus.com/post/analyzing-nginx-access-logs), I showed how Timeplus Proton can be used to analyze web traffic in production using just the log files generated by an Nginx web server. The article explored real-time analysis and historical analysis but the analysis wasn't visualized. 

This article will remedy the lack of rich visualizations by showing how to do so using open source tools like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/).


## Prerequisities
In addition to Timeplus Proton, the previous article used the following technologies: 
* [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) (VPC);
* [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) (EC2);
* [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System);
* [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io/);
* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/);
* [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/).
  
The first two require access to an AWS account, if you didn't have one already. The last two products need to have been running in production, in order to have meaningful access log data to experiment with. 

To make this article super easy to follow, while building on the same analysis used in the previous article, you only need: 
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/);
* [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io/). 

Timeplus Proton has a handy feature [`RANDOM STREAM`](https://docs.timeplus.com/proton-create-stream#create-random-stream) which we will use to generate all the access log data that we will use for experimentation in this article.

Let's dive in!
