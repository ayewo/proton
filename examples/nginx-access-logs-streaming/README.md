# Streaming Nginx Access Logs to Timeplus Proton 
In a [recent article](https://www.timeplus.com/post/log-stream-analysis), we walked through three different ways by which Timeplus Proton could be used to ingest and analyse its own log files.

In this article Iâ€™ll explore a related theme: using Timeplus Proton to analyze web traffic in real-time to a Node.js blog that is behind an Nginx web server. As a bonus, I will also analyze past traffic numbers for the blog by comparing Timeplus Proton's traffic numbers with the traffic numbers reported by [Umami](https://umami.is). (Umami is an open source, privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics.)

## todo
- [ ] setup a VPC
- [ ] start another EC2 instance inside the VPC running Proton
- [ ] ship historical logs to Proton
- [ ] ship live logs to Proton
  - [ ] share the log file using Amazon EFS?
- [ ] analysis
  - [ ] stats on malformed requests: 404, 403, 401
  - [ ] review nginx error logs too ?
  - [ ] compare Umami analytics with raw access logs to account for ad-blocker traffic
