# Visualizing Nginx Access Logs using Grafana
In my last [blog post](https://www.timeplus.com/post/analyzing-nginx-access-logs), I showed how Timeplus Proton can be used to analyze web traffic in production using just the log files generated by an Nginx web server. The article explored real-time analysis and historical analysis but the analysis wasn't visualized. 

This article will remedy the lack of rich visualizations by showing how to do so using open source tools like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).


## Prerequisites
In addition to Timeplus Proton, the previous article used the following technologies: 
* [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) (VPC);
* [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) (EC2);
* [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System);
* [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io/);
* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/);
* [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/).
  
The first two require access to an AWS account. The last two products need to have been running in production, in order to have meaningful access log data to experiment with. 

This article builds on the same analysis of the previous article but is quicker to get started as you only need: 
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed;
* an [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) account. 

Timeplus Proton has a handy feature [`RANDOM STREAM`](https://docs.timeplus.com/proton-create-stream#create-random-stream) which we will use to generate all the access log data needed for experimentation in this article. 

Before I dive into the article proper, I will first revisit the format used by Nginx to record access log data so that the data we'll generate will mimic its shape and properties.

## The Shape of Nginx's Access Log Data
In the [previous article](https://www.timeplus.com/post/analyzing-nginx-access-logs), we briefly touched on the Nginx access logs but did not dwell on its location or how the data it contains should be parsed.

### Nginx Access Log Data
The access logs for Nginx are typically written to the file `/var/log/nginx/access.log`. Here's an excerpt from my blog's access logs:
```bash
161.35.230.x - - [26/Jun/2023:06:33:53 +0000] "\x00\x0E8uON\x85J\xCF\xC5\x93\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" 400 182 "-" "-"
51.79.29.xx - - [26/Jun/2023:06:37:04 +0000] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 301 57 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/81.0.4044.129 Safari/537.36"
179.43.177.xxx - - [26/Jun/2023:06:45:28 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 60 "-" "Hello World"
87.236.176.xxx - - [26/Jun/2023:07:58:36 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 6364 "https://www.ayewo.com/" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; InternetMeasurement/1.0; +https://internet-measurement.com/)"
87.236.176.xxx - - [26/Jun/2023:07:58:38 +0000] "GET /favicon.png HTTP/2.0" 200 7636 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; InternetMeasurement/1.0; +https://internet-measurement.com/)"
93.126.72.xxx - - [26/Jun/2023:08:29:38 +0000] "GET /how-to-install-rsync-on-windows/ HTTP/2.0" 200 6394 "https://www.google.com/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
```

The first line in the access log is from the IP address `161.35.230.x`. 

![nginx access log - first line](images/01_nginx-access-log-1st-line.png)

We'll look at the Nginx access log format to understand what each field on that line means.

### Nginx Access Log Format
Nginx's [access log format](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/#setting-up-the-access-log) is specified in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and it broadly looks like this:
```bash
http {
    log_format compression '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
                           '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                           '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent"';

    server {
        access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
        ...
    }
}
```

Here's the first line we saw earlier, but this time annotated to show individual fields from the log format.

![nginx access log - first line - annotated](images/02_nginx-access-log-1st-line.png)

We can see that the log format uses a single space as separator between fields. 

To parse that line reliably, we can use this Python regex:
```python
import re

line = '161.35.230.x - - [26/Jun/2023:06:33:53 +0000] "\x00\x0E8uON\x85J\xCF\xC5\x93\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" 400 182 "-" "-"'

malicious_pattern = re.compile(r'(?P<remote_addr>\S+).(?P<rfc1413_ident>\S+).(?P<remote_user>\S+).\[(?P<time_local>[^\]]+)\] "(?P<request>[^"]*)" (?P<status>\d+) (?P<body_bytes_sent>\d+) "(?P<http_referer>[^"]*)" "(?P<http_user_agent>[^"]*)"')
match = malicious_pattern.match(line)
```

The results of parsing the first line are shown in the table below:
|  #   | Field | Value |
|------|--------|------------------|
| 1 | `$remote_addr` | 161.35.230.x |
| 2 | `$rfc1413_ident` | - |
| 3 | `$remote_user` | - |
| 4 | `$time_local` | 26/Jun/2023:06:33:53 +0000 |
| 5 | `$request` | \x00\x0E8uON\x85J\xCF\xC5\x93\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00 |
| 6 | `$status` | 400 |
| 7 | `$body_bytes_sent` | 182 |
| 8 | `$http_referer` | - |
| 9 | `$http_user_agent` | - |

It is clear from looking at the contents of the 5th field (i.e. `$request`) that the first line is actually a maliciously crafted request. The `$request` didn't specify a valid [HTTP protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110) method (e.g. `GET`, `POST` or `OPTIONS`) to the server which is why the server responded with a HTTP `status` code of 400 (Bad Request).

Let's use the Python regex to parse the second line:
|  #   | Field | Value |
|------|--------|------------------|
| 1 | `$remote_addr` | 51.79.29.xx |
| 2 | `$rfc1413_ident` | - |
| 3 | `$remote_user` | - |
| 4 | `$time_local` | 26/Jun/2023:06:37:04 +0000 |
| 5 | `$request` | POST / HTTP/1.1 |
| 6 | `$status` | 301 |
| 7 | `$body_bytes_sent` | 57 |
| 8 | `$http_referer` | - |
| 9 | `$http_user_agent` | Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/81.0.4044.129 Safari/537.36 |

Unlike the first line, this second line is a valid `$request` because `POST / HTTP/1.1` can be broken into 3 strings that conform to the HTTP protocol. 

A valid HTTP request should allow being split into three parts. Similar to the Nginx access log format, the separator between the 3 parts of a valid HTTP request is also a single space.

* `POST`: indicates the HTTP verb or method
* `/`: indicates the request URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) or path
* `HTTP/1.1`: indicates the HTTP version in use for the request

Here's the second line from that log file again with the `$request` field annotated to show the three parts (in orange):
![nginx access log - second line - annotated](images/02_nginx-access-log-2nd-line.png)

Since we can going to use Timeplus Proton to perform aggregations on the top requested pages later, we can slightly modify the Python regex to allow us parse the 3 parts that make up a `$request` into 3 separate columns.

Since the To parse this 2nd line, we can use the same regex but with some slight modifications:
```python
import re

line = '51.79.29.xx - - [26/Jun/2023:06:37:04 +0000] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 301 57 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/81.0.4044.129 Safari/537.36"'

pattern = re.compile(r'(?P<remote_addr>\S+).(?P<rfc1413_ident>\S+).(?P<remote_user>\S+).\[(?P<time_local>\S+ \+[0-9]{4})]."(?P<http_verb>\S+) (?P<path>\S+) (?P<http_ver>\S+)" (?P<status>[0-9]+) (?P<body_bytes_sent>\S+) "(?P<http_referer>.*)" "(?P<http_user_agent>.*)"\s*\Z')
match = pattern.match(line)
```

To understand the difference between the two regexes, let's try to present the results of parsing lines 1 and 2 in a tabular format:



It is clear now that the first line is actually a maliciously crafted request that doesn't even specify a HTTP method (i.e. `GET` or `OPTIONS`) to the server which is why the server responded with a HTTP 400 code (Bad Request).

There are several of such malformed requests in the access logs that are tricky to parse which is why an additional column `malicious_request` was added to the `nginx_historical_access_log` stream which was created in the previous article.

Below is a brief explanation of how each access log line is parsed into 12 columns:
* `$remote_addr` is stored in column `remote_ip` of type `ipv4`;
* `-` is stored in column `rfc1413_ident` of type `string`;
* `$remote_user` is stored in column `remote_user` of type `string`;
* `$time_local` os stored in column `date_time` of type `datetime64`;
* `$request` is split into 4 columns each of type `string` to make our analysis easier:
  * column `http_verb` of type `string`;
  * column `path` of type `string` and;
  * column `http_ver` of type `string`;
  * column `malicious_request` of type `string` for any `$request` that fails to parse correctly; 
* `$status` is stored in column `status` of type `int`;
* `$body_bytes_sent` is stored in column `size` of type `int`;
* `$http_referer` is stored in column `referer` of type `string`;
* `$http_user_agent` is stored in column `user_agent` of type `string`.

The previous article created a stream with a total of 12 columns to take advantage of Timeplus Proton's fast aggregation for our analysis. We will reuse the same approach in this article. 

With that out of the way, let's dive into this article proper!


## Docker Environment
The [`docker-compose.yaml`](docker-compose.yaml) file defines 3 containers:
* a Timeplus Proton container;
* a Grafana container;
* a third container that seeds the Timeplus Proton container with access log data.

### DDL Overview
The 3rd container uses the `proton client` to seed the Timeplus Proton database with access log data from an SQL file: 
* [`01_nginx-access-log.sql`](01_nginx-access-log.sql). 

The SQL file contains the following DDL:
![SQL code screenshot with line numbers](images/03_nginx-access-log.png)

### Generating Data to Mimic Nginx Access Data
On line 3, the [`CREATE RANDOM STREAM`](https://docs.timeplus.com/proton-create-stream#create-random-stream) DDL is used to create a random stream named `nginx_access_log`. 

Just like in the previous article, the stream also has 12 columns. Each column is randomly assigned a `default` value as you can see on lines 4 - 30.

Using the line numbers 4 - 30 as reference, the table below goes over each column and the database [functions](https://docs.timeplus.com/functions) used to generate test data.
| Line  | Column | `default` | 
|------|--------|------------------|
| 4 | `remote_ip` | [`random_in_type('ipv4')`](https://docs.timeplus.com/functions_for_random#random_in_type): returns a random [ipv4](https://docs.timeplus.com/datatypes) representing a user's IP address. |
| 5 | `rfc1413_ident` | `default`s to '-' but should be a string conforming to [RFC1413](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1413). Currently unused. |
| 6 | `remote_user` | `default`s to '-' since most blog traffic is from unauthenticated users. Currently unused. |
| 7 | `date_time` | `random_in_type('datetime64', 365, y -> to_time('2023-6-17') + interval y day)`: [`random_in_type('datetime64')`](https://docs.timeplus.com/functions_for_random#random_in_type) between 2023-6-17 & a 1-yr interval i.e. [2023-06-17, 2024-06-17). |
| 8 | `http_verb` | `['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'HEAD'][rand()%5]`: uses [`rand()`](https://docs.timeplus.com/functions_for_random#rand) to return a random index between [0, 5) in this 5-element array. The array samples 5 of the [39 HTTP verbs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41411152/how-many-http-verbs-are-there). |
| 9 | `path` | `['/rss/', '/', '/sitemap.xml', '/favicon.ico', '/robots.txt', ...][rand()%11]`: uses [`rand()`](https://docs.timeplus.com/functions_for_random#rand) to return a random index between [0, 11) in this 11-element array of sample URL subpaths. |
| 10 | `http_ver` | `['HTTP/1.0', 'HTTP/1.1', 'HTTP/2.0'][rand()%3]`: similar to `path`. |
| 11 | `status` | `[200, 301, 302, 304, 400, 404][rand()%6]`: similar to `path`. |
| 12 | `size` | `rand()%5000000`: uses `rand()` to generate a random amount of [bytes sent](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30837653), up to `~5MB`. |
| 13 | `referer` | `['-', 'https://ayewo.com/', '...', 'https://google.com/'][rand()%4]`: similar to `path`. |
| 14 | `user_agent` | `['...', '...', ...][rand()%14]`: similar to `path`. |
| 30 | `malicious_request` | `if(rand()%100 < 5, '\x16\...', '')`: returns a malformed sequence whenever `rand()%100` is < 5. |
  




### Random Streams
There is an important note about the design of random streams in Timeplus Proton mentioned in the [`RANDOM STREAM`](https://docs.timeplus.com/proton-create-stream#create-random-stream) documentation that is worth highlighting here:
> [!NOTE]
> The data of random stream is kept in memory during the query time. If you are not querying the random stream, there is no data generated or kept in memory.

Essentially, each time you run a query like `SELECT remote_ip, rfc1413_ident, remote_user, date_time, http_verb, path, http_ver, status, size, referer, user_agent, malicious_request FROM nginx_access_log LIMIT 1;`, you'll get a different (random) result from the stream.

For instance, running that query yields the following output:
```sql
SELECT
  remote_ip, rfc1413_ident, remote_user, date_time, http_verb, path, http_ver, status, size, referer, user_agent, malicious_request
FROM
  nginx_access_log
LIMIT 1

Query id: d4b7f92c-bcd8-42ec-94ef-655eae86861b

┌─remote_ip─────┬─rfc1413_ident─┬─remote_user─┬───────────────date_time─┬─http_verb─┬─path─────────┬─http_ver─┬─status─┬──size─┬─referer─┬─user_agent────┬─malicious_request─┐

1 row in set. Elapsed: 0.012 sec.
```

Running it again, yields this output:
```sql
SELECT
  remote_ip, rfc1413_ident, remote_user, date_time, http_verb, path, http_ver, status, size, referer, user_agent, malicious_request

  nginx_access_log
LIMIT 1

1 row in set. Elapsed: 0.013 sec. 
```

Due to this design decision, we will need to create a snapshot from the random stream to serve as our test data. This snapshot will represent our access log data so we can reliably geolocate the latitude and longitude of each (randomly generated) IP address before we can correctly visualize them in Grafana.

Afterwards, the article will use the random stream to illustrate streaming queries in Grafana.
